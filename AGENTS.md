## Project: StateSpec

StateSpec is a canonical, text-first software design language for distributed systems. It defines entities, state machines, APIs, workflows, ownership boundaries, parent-child relationships, and orchestration semantics in a deterministic specification format.

The project goal is to make software design explicit, verifiable, generatable, and editable through both text and IDE-assisted visual tooling.

StateSpec source files use the `.sspec` extension.

---

## Core Product Principles

1. **Text is the source of truth**
   - `.sspec` files are canonical.
   - Visual editors, diagrams, and generated artifacts must derive from text.
   - No secondary visual model may become authoritative.

2. **Low ambiguity by design**
   - Prefer explicit syntax over inference.
   - Avoid aliases for language keywords.
   - Avoid optional semantics for critical behavior.
   - Prefer one canonical way to express each concept.

3. **Formatter defines the written language**
   - The formatter must produce stable, deterministic output.
   - Field ordering, indentation, spacing, and block structure should be canonical.
   - Generated examples should always be formatted.

4. **Compiler core owns semantics**
   - Parser, semantic analyzer, IR, formatter, CLI, LSP, and generators must agree on one semantic model.
   - Do not duplicate semantic rules independently across CLI, VS Code extension, or generators.

5. **Generated code is downstream**
   - Generated OpenAPI, protobuf, server stubs, worker skeletons, migrations, diagrams, and tests are outputs of the spec.
   - Generators consume canonical IR, not raw AST.

## Architecture

The intended pipeline is:

```text
.sspec text
    ↓
parser
    ↓
AST
    ↓
semantic analyzer
    ↓
canonical IR
    ↓
formatter / CLI / LSP / generators / VS Code extension
```

### Key rule

Generators, diagrams, and editor features should consume the semantic model or canonical IR wherever possible. Avoid building features directly against raw text unless the feature is purely syntactic.

---

## Binding Runtime Persistence Model

Binding interface code that reads or writes persisted StateSpec runtime state must use the optimistic-concurrency-control backend model.

This applies to all language bindings, including C++, Go, Java, and Rust, and to every runtime component that can observe persisted state:

- entity/document access
- leases
- queues
- workflows
- feature flags
- generated runtime helpers that inspect, evaluate, claim, enqueue, start, complete, fail, cancel, register, or otherwise depend on persisted records

### OCC rule

Persistent reads must be transaction-scoped.

Do not add binding APIs that read persisted state through standalone resolver/client interfaces that bypass `Backend`/`IBackend` and `Transaction`/`ITransaction`. A read that influences generated behavior, workflow branching, feature flag evaluation, queue claiming, lease acquisition, or entity mutation must participate in the same OCC transaction as the operation that consumes that read.

### Required binding shape

Runtime binding components should expose both method styles when they operate on persisted state:

1. Backend-managed methods that take a backend and own transaction lifecycle internally.
2. Caller-managed `Tx` methods that take an existing transaction so callers can compose multiple reads and writes atomically.

Backend-managed methods are expected to follow:

```text
begin transaction
perform persisted reads/writes through the transaction
commit on success
abort on failure
```

Caller-managed methods must not begin, commit, or abort the transaction they receive unless their contract explicitly says so.

### Feature flag rule

Feature flag usage is persisted-state access. Evaluation must be available as a transaction-scoped binding API, because generated workflows and services may branch on feature flag values while also reading or mutating entities, leases, queues, or workflow records.

### Generator rule

Generated binding code must consume these transaction-aware interfaces. Generators must not emit direct persisted-state reads, in-memory feature flag resolvers, or target-language helper APIs that bypass the canonical backend transaction model.

## Language Concepts

StateSpec v0.1 includes these system-level concepts:

- `system`
- `tenant scoped_by`
- `system_tenant configured`
- `namespace`
- `value`
- `enum`
- `shape`
- `external_system`
- `feature_flag`
- `log`
- `metric`
- `entity`
- `event`
- `queue`
- `lease`
- `worker`
- `api`
- `workflow`
- `policy`
- `annotations`

`state` declarations are not top-level objects; they belong inside an entity
`state_machine`.

Entities are durable system objects. Feature flags model declared rollout and
configuration switches. Logs and metrics model declared observability signals. Queues and
leases model durable runtime coordination. Workers bind execution to queues, leases, and
workflows. Workflows describe asynchronous execution. APIs expose external contracts.
Events connect APIs, workflows, and workers. Policies express authorization, tenancy,
quota, and audit intent.

---

## Entity Rules

Entities represent durable objects with identity, ownership, lifecycle, fields, relationships, and invariants.

Canonical entity shape:

```sspec
entity Name {
  key id: uuid

  ownership {
    authority: system
    system_of_record: self
    lifecycle: authoritative
  }

  version: int
  state: NameState

  relations { }
  children { }
  fields { }
  transitions { }
  invariants { }
  indexes { }
  annotations { }
}
```

### Entity invariants

- Every entity must have exactly one `key` in v0.
- Entity names use PascalCase.
- Field names use lowerCamelCase.
- State fields must reference declared `state` types.
- State transitions must reference valid state members.
- Workflows may not introduce undeclared state transitions.

---

## Ownership Model

Ownership is first-class.

Supported authority modes:

- `system` — this system is authoritative.
- `external` — another system is authoritative.

Supported lifecycle modes:

- `authoritative` — this system owns create/update/delete lifecycle.
- `managed` — this system requests lifecycle actions from another authority.
- `observed` — this system reads or caches externally-owned data.
- `projected` — this entity is a local projection or read model.

### Rule

Do not model externally-owned resources as if local state is authoritative. If this system creates a resource through another system’s REST API, prefer either:

1. a managed external entity, or
2. a pair of entities:
   - a local authoritative request/orchestration entity
   - an externally-owned managed resource entity

---

## Parent/Child Relationships

Parent-child relationships are first-class.

The child entity declares the relationship in `relations`:

```sspec
relations {
  parent clusterId: ref<Cluster> {
    kind: composition
    on_parent_delete: cascade
    unique_within_parent: [ordinal]
  }
}
```

The parent may optionally declare an inverse view:

```sspec
children {
  nodes: Node by clusterId
}
```

### Rules

- The child owns the parent reference.
- Parent-side `children` declarations are optional readability and generation hints.
- Composition relationships must not form cycles.
- `unique_within_parent` fields must exist on the child.
- `parent_must_be_in` states must exist on the parent state type.
- `detach` delete behavior requires an optional parent reference.

---

## Workflow Model

Workflows are durable, restart-safe descriptions of asynchronous execution.

Workflows should:

- load one primary entity
- declare preconditions with `require`
- mutate entity state only through legal transitions
- emit events explicitly
- call external systems through named steps
- be idempotent across retries

### Workflow state doctrine

Entity state is the durable contract between workflows.

Parent workflows should not depend on private child workflow internals. Parent workflows should observe child entity state.

---

## Child Orchestration Pattern

StateSpec supports a canonical three-phase pattern for parent workflows that create child entities.

### Phase 1: `generate_child_ids`

Atomically generate child IDs and store them on the parent in a pending list.

### Phase 2: `creating_children`

For each pending child ID:

- create the child entity
- emit the child creation event
- move the child ID from pending to creating

### Phase 3: `waiting_children`

Monitor child entity state for each creating child ID:

- move successful children to succeeded list
- move failed children to failed list
- complete or fail the parent based on aggregate child state

Preferred bucket fields:

```sspec
pendingChildIds: list<uuid>
creatingChildIds: list<uuid>
succeededChildIds: list<uuid>
failedChildIds: list<uuid>
```

Prefer `succeededChildIds` over `activeChildIds`, because not every child success terminal state is named `Active`.

### Required invariants

Child ID buckets must be disjoint and conserved:

```sspec
invariants {
  childIdsPartitioned:
    disjoint(pendingChildIds, creatingChildIds, succeededChildIds, failedChildIds)

  childIdsConserved:
    count(pendingChildIds) +
    count(creatingChildIds) +
    count(succeededChildIds) +
    count(failedChildIds) == desiredChildCount
}
```

### Idempotency rule

Child creation must be retry-safe. A repeated `creating_children` step must not duplicate child entities or relaunch already-created child work incorrectly.

## Grammar Ownership

The grammar lives in:

```text
grammar/statespec.ebnf
```

Any grammar change must update, as applicable:

- parser tests
- semantic tests
- formatter tests
- examples
- language documentation
- VS Code syntax highlighting
- LSP completion and diagnostics

Do not change grammar without adding valid and invalid examples.

---

## Parser Guidelines

The parser should:

- preserve source spans for diagnostics
- recover from common syntax errors for editor use
- produce useful diagnostics rather than stopping at the first error
- avoid embedding semantic validation in syntax parsing

Parser output should be AST, not IR.

---

## Semantic Analyzer Guidelines

The semantic analyzer should own:

- name resolution
- type checking
- state validation
- transition validation
- relationship validation
- ownership validation
- workflow validation
- child-set validation
- invariant validation

Examples of semantic errors:

- unknown entity reference
- unknown state member
- invalid transition
- invalid parent relation
- child bucket type mismatch
- workflow state update not allowed by transition graph
- externally-owned entity claiming authoritative local transition behavior

---

## IR Guidelines

Canonical IR should be:

- fully resolved
- normalized
- stable for generators
- independent of source formatting
- explicit about defaults

Generators should consume IR, not AST.

IR should distinguish:

- syntax-level names
- resolved entity/type references
- authoritative vs external ownership
- parent-child relationships
- local lifecycle state vs observed external state
- workflow steps and child orchestration phases

---

## Formatter Guidelines

Formatter output must be deterministic.

Canonical ordering inside `entity`:

1. `key`
2. `ownership`
3. `version`
4. `state`
5. `relations`
6. `children`
7. `fields`
8. `transitions`
9. `invariants`
10. `indexes`
11. `annotations`

Canonical ordering inside `workflow`:

1. `on`
2. `load`
3. `require`
4. `child_set`
5. `step`

Do not introduce formatting options until there is a strong reason. One canonical style is preferred.

---

## CLI Guidelines

The CLI should expose simple commands:

```bash
statespec validate
statespec fmt
statespec generate
statespec graph
statespec diff
statespec doctor
statespec lsp
```

CLI behavior should be suitable for CI.

- `validate` exits non-zero on syntax or semantic errors.
- `fmt --check` exits non-zero if files are not formatted.
- `generate --check` exits non-zero if generated output is stale.

---

## VS Code Extension Guidelines

The VS Code extension is preferred over a standalone visual editor.

The extension should provide:

- syntax highlighting
- diagnostics
- autocomplete
- hover documentation
- outline view
- go to definition
- find references
- rename
- formatting
- state graph visualization
- workflow graph visualization
- command palette actions for validation and generation

### Source of truth rule

Visual editing must rewrite `.sspec` text. It must not maintain a separate authoritative model.

---

## Generator Guidelines

Generators should be separated by target:

- OpenAPI
- protobuf
- Go
- Java
- Rust
- diagrams
- tests

Each generator should:

- consume canonical IR
- be deterministic
- have golden tests
- avoid hidden runtime assumptions
- emit clear warnings for unsupported language features

Generated output should include a header indicating it is generated from StateSpec.

---

## Testing Guidelines

Use golden tests for:

- parser output
- formatter output
- semantic diagnostics
- generated artifacts
- graph output

Suggested testdata layout:

```text
testdata/
├── parser/
├── semantic/
├── formatter/
├── generators/
└── lsp/
```

Every language feature should have:

- at least one valid example
- at least one invalid example
- formatter coverage
- semantic validation coverage

---

## Examples Policy

Examples are part of the language contract.

Keep examples realistic and aligned with intended use cases:

- control plane resources
- API + worker architectures
- parent-child orchestration
- externally-managed resources
- lifecycle-driven services

Examples should be small enough to understand but complete enough to validate.

---

## Documentation Policy

Docs should be kept close to the language design.

Recommended docs:

```text
docs/language/overview.md
docs/language/grammar.md
docs/language/entities.md
docs/language/workflows.md
docs/language/ownership.md
docs/tooling/cli.md
docs/tooling/vscode-extension.md
```

Any grammar or semantic change should update docs in the same PR.

---

## Naming Conventions

- Entities: `PascalCase`
- States: `PascalCase`
- State members: `PascalCase`
- APIs: `PascalCase`
- Workflows: `PascalCase`
- Events: `PascalCase`
- Fields: `lowerCamelCase`
- Steps: `snake_case`
- Child sets: `lowerCamelCase` or plural lowerCamelCase

Preferred workflow step names for child orchestration:

- `generate_child_ids`
- `creating_children`
- `waiting_children`

---

## Compatibility and Versioning

Language versions should be explicit once the grammar stabilizes.

Breaking changes include:

- keyword changes
- grammar changes that invalidate existing specs
- semantic reinterpretation of existing constructs
- IR changes that alter generator behavior

Non-breaking changes include:

- new optional blocks
- new generators
- new diagnostics
- stricter warnings that are not errors

---

## Pull Request Expectations

A PR that changes the language should include:

- grammar update
- parser update
- semantic validation update
- formatter update if syntax is affected
- docs update
- examples update
- valid and invalid tests

A PR that changes generators should include:

- IR compatibility check
- golden output updates
- documentation if user-facing behavior changes

A PR that changes VS Code behavior should include:

- extension tests where practical
- LSP tests for language behavior
- screenshots or notes for visual changes when useful

---

## Things to Avoid

Avoid:

- adding syntax aliases
- adding dynamic typing
- adding untyped `any` as an escape hatch
- putting business semantics in annotations
- letting generators define semantics
- letting the VS Code extension diverge from CLI validation
- creating standalone diagram state separate from `.sspec`
- modeling external resources as locally authoritative
- launching child workflows without durable child entity state

---

## Current Design Biases

StateSpec is optimized for:

- distributed systems
- REST API + worker architectures
- control planes
- lifecycle-managed resources
- parent-child orchestration
- idempotent async workflows
- code generation
- VS Code-first developer experience

It is not intended to be:

- a general-purpose programming language
- a replacement for Rust, Go, Java, or C++
- a diagram-only modeling tool
- a free-form requirements language

---

## One-Sentence Project Doctrine

StateSpec turns distributed system design into canonical, executable text: entities define durable state, APIs express intent, workflows drive lifecycle, and generated artifacts derive from one validated source of truth.
